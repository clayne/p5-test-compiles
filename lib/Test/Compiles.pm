=head1 NAME

Test::Compiles - tests if perl can compile a string of code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::More;
 use Test::Compiles;
 
 compiles       q{ print "hello world" };
 doesnt_compile q{ print "hello world  };   # missing end of quote
 
 done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Compiles exports two functions to allow you to check whether a
string of code can be compiled by perl without errors. It doesn't check
whether it can be I<executed>.

Note that Perl code can execute arbitrary instructions as part of its
compilation (e.g. in a C<< BEGIN { ... } >> block), so don't pass
untrusted strings to these test functions.

=over

=item C<< compiles $code, $message, %options >>

=item C<< compiles $code, %options >>

=item C<< compiles $code, $message >>

=item C<< compiles $code >>

This test passes if C<< $code >> can be compiled.

Valid options are:

=over

=item * C<strict>: boolean to indicate whether code should be compiled
with C<< use strict >>. Enabled by default.

=item * C<warnings>: boolean to indicate whether code should be
compiled with C<< use warnings FATAL => 'all' >>. Disabled by default.

=item * C<package>: package that the code should be compiled in.
Defaults to the caller.

=item * C<prelude>: a string of Perl code to prepend to C<< $code >>.
Defaults to C<< $Test::Compiles::PRELUDE >>, which is (by default) an
empty string.

=item * C<message>: an alternative to specifying C<< $message >>.

=back

=item C<< doesnt_compile $code, $message, %options >>

=item C<< doesnt_compile $code, %options >>

=item C<< doesnt_compile $code, $message >>

=item C<< doesnt_compile $code >>

This test passes if C<< $code >> cannot be compiled. It accepts the
same options.

=back

This module defines a package variable C<< $Test::Compiles::PRELUDE >>
which can be used to, for example, load pragmata like L<indirect> or
L<bareword::filehandles>.
